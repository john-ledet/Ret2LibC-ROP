# Ret2LibC-ROP
1. Write an application vulnerable to buffer overflow.  2. Exploit this buffer overflow with a ret2libc (or ROP, you choose)) payload to show the application is vulnerable.  3. Patch the code to eliminate the buffer overflow vulnerability.  4. Demonstrate that the code is not vulnerable anymore.
